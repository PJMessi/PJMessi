## About me
I have a deep understanding of backend web development, with expertise in **Golang** and **NodeJS**, including **JavaScript**, **TypeScript**, and **NestJS**. Additionally, I've worked with **.NET Core**, **PHP**, and **Python** intermittently throughout my career.

I have hands-on experience with Monolithic, Microservice, and Serverless architectures. In microservices, I’ve primarily worked with gRPC, Protocol Buffers (protobuf), and Kafka for efficient communication and data streaming. For serverless projects, I’ve leveraged tools from AWS such as Lambda, SQS, and SNS, as well as Google Cloud Functions to build scalable, event-driven systems.

I’ve primarily worked with relational databases like PostgreSQL and MySQL, and I'm well-versed in their internal data storage and indexing mechanisms, allowing me to design schemas effectively. Recently, I've also worked with DynamoDB, which uses a different data storage approach compared to relational databases. I can design effective schemas for DynamoDB as well.

Besides this, I have experience with essential backend tools such as Docker, Terraform, Kubernetes, Elasticsearch, Git, Redis, RabbitMQ, etc as well as implementing CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions and CircleCI.

I’m skilled at writing unit tests, utilizing interfaces and mocking techniques effectively, as well as creating end-to-end tests.

While I haven't worked full-time on frontend development professionally, I have experience with Vue.js and React from the times I’ve worked on frontend projects.

**Willing to learn Anything that is required of me :)**

yep, thats about it!
